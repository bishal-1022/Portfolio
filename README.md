# Portfolio
My portfolio website is a personal project that I developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 It serves as an online showcase of my skills, experiences, and Certification. 
 The website features a clean and modern design, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
